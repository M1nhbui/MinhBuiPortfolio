      Hi, I'm Minh Bui! <img src="html_finalprojimages/waving-hand.png" width="60px" />
    </h1>
    <p>
      I’m from Hanoi, Vietnam, and I moved to the U.S. in 2024 to start college at the University of
      Wisconsin-Madison. Back in high school, I went to Nguyen Hue High School for the Gifted, where I was in the
      Informatics class. I’ve always loved programming and math—I’ve been into advanced math since elementary school
      and started competitive programming in 10th grade using C++, which is still my favorite language. <br />
      In my first year at UW-Madison, I took several CS-related courses such as Java Object-Oriented Programming, Data
      Structures and Algorithms, Discrete Mathematics, and Linear Algebra. I also like solving problems on Leetcode
      every day to practice and improve. It’s been exciting so far, and I’m looking forward to learning even more!
